# Taskly - Personal Calendar Application
A Java application that allows users to stay organized. This is done through the use of a fully functional calendar and to-do list.

# General Description
This application was created for my ICS4U culminating project. All the code was done through Java. This program is a person calendar application. Users can create their own individual accounts from where they can access a functional calendar, a to do list and be able to add events and tasks to them. This is in hopes to increase organization and productivity in the user's life. 

# How To Get It Working
Start off by downloading the code via zip file. Open the folder through eclipse (any other IDE's should work). The key part to prevent errors appearing is to properly add the jar file included in the folder. Right click on your project > select build path > select configure build path > select libraries > select add external JARs > import the JAR file > select apply and close. After that, enjoy the application!

# Inspiration
During my high school years, I found myself struggling to keep up with things. Lacking organization skills, I began to fall behind. Later on, I was able to discover applications that helped me track and keep up with things. These include calendar and to-do list applications. Upon using them for a period of time, I realized the significance and impact it can have on an individual's life. I was finally able to dig myself out of the hole, and stay organized. There was one problem though. I was using two different applications; one for a calendar app and one for a to-do list app. This became very difficult to maintain. As a result, I decided to create an application that included both features within one app. This is in hopes of making it easier for the user's lives, while also allowing them to be on top of their tasks, events, etc. 

# Features
The applications consists of many features. A sign-up/log-in feature is incorporated to help increase privacy within users. In addition, a fully navigable calendar and to-do list is created allowing users to add tasks and events to them. One special feature that many of these other applications lack is a list of upcoming events and tasks. This specific lists displays and reminds users of events/tasks that are coming within the next 2 weeks. In addition, a setting feature is incorporated to allow users to change their personal information and profile picture. Finally, a help feature is located that gives the user a step by step on how to use each screen.

# Challenges
One signficant obstacle that arose was creating a fully functional calendar. Many instances arose where the dates, years, etc would be incorrect, and required me to try various different algorithms. In addition, another obstacle that arose throughout the span of the project was the idea of saving and loading user's past information. I had to mess around with reading and writing text files in order to ensure it was successful. Overall, I am proud of the product I have been able to create.

# What I've Learned
Since this was a final summative project, I had to showcase what I have learned throughout the course. Throughout this project, I have demonstrated the use of conditional statements, syntax, algorithms, and most importantly OOP. Since I had COVID-19 throughout majority of the project, one key takeaway is being able to stay committed while dealing with other problems (i.e. being sick). 

# What's Next For Taskly
Since there was a time constraint for when the project was to be finished, I wasn't able to implement various features I wished to add. Hopefully, when the time comes, I wish to include many more features to help increase the effectivness of the application. One possible feature I wish to include is including an option where the user can change the background of the application. This will allow the user to set their preferences and be creative. Not only that, but another feature I wish to include is incorporating a search bar, where the user can search for events in the calendar, and it will take them to that date. On top of that, I wish to include a button where it takes the user to the current date on the calendar. This can be useful if at times they have scrolled through the calendar extensively and wish to return back to todayâ€™s date. I wish to dedicate a portion of the screens to a current time where the user can see the time it is for them. Hopefully, I can include such additional features and functions in the application to make the application more detailed and comprehensive, and unique from any pre-existing similar programs.
